## âœ¨ Features

- Basic arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- expression parsing using expression tree
- Simple and readable Rust implementation

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### ðŸ›  Dev Build
```bash
cargo build 
```
### ðŸ›  Release Build
```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Further Development
- [x] Expression validity checks (e.g., unbalanced parentheses, invalid tokens).
- [x] Support for multi-digit numbers (currently parses only single-digit).
- [x] Support for floating point numbers.
- [ ] New Expression Language implementation
- [ ] Support for variables
- [ ] Support for strictly numerical vector datatypes
